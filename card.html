        <p class="paragraph">Wolves develop close relationships and strong social bonds. They often demonstrate deep affection for their family and may even sacrifice themselves to protect the family unit. They have a highly organised social structure enabling them to enjoy
          maximum cooperation when hunting, communicating and defending territory. </p>

        <p class="description">The domestic dog shares many wolf traits. Once a wolf has found a mate, they usually stay together for life. The wolf was held in high esteem by the Dacians, whose name was derived from the Gaulish Daoi, meaning "wolf people". The wolf was viewed as the lord of all animals, and as the only effective power against evil.</p>
